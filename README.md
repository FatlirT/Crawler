Web crawler made to scrape prices of appliances from various websites.

TODO: 

- Improve Crawler Class' structure and interface.
- Add support for other  input streams.
- Use multi-threading.
- Outsmart Crawler prevention measures such as Google CAPTCHA by cycling user agents, adding delay between connection requests, cycling proxies.


Possible Future Features:

- Make use of website APIs to get prices instead.
- Train AI to find correct prices.
